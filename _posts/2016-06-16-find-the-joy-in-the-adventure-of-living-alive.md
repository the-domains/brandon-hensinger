  No matter what I've done, and no matter where I've been in my life, there has
  always been a deep rooted pull to the mountains in my soul. When I'm out in
  the wilderness, when I'm standing on the top of a rocky peak, when I'm
  suspended on the side of a cliff pondering my next move, I am always impacted
  by the beauty and simplicity of the mountains and being outside. I can't help
  but think, every time, that this is what the world was meant to be like.
  Peaceful, beautiful, and begging to be experienced.

No matter what I've done, and no matter where I've been in my life, there has always been a deep rooted pull to the mountains in my soul. When I'm out in the wilderness, when I'm standing on the top of a rocky peak, when I'm suspended on the side of a cliff pondering my next move, I am always impacted by the beauty and simplicity of the mountains and being outside. I can't help but think, every time, that this is what the world was meant to be like. Peaceful, beautiful, and begging to be experienced. 

I am passionate about pursuing incredible experiences...whether that be through the outdoors and climbing, traveling the world and exploring new cultures, trying new foods, writing music, or just hanging out with family and friends. Not only do I love these experiences, I love to inspire others to pursue their own incredible experiences. Join me and find the joy in the adventure of living alive!

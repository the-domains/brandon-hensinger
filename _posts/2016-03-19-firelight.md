This is my final life

You brought me to this point

So many years ago

How did ours paths diverge

When we always walked side by side

How did you ever deviate?

Maybe cause you didn't see

Tears fall on water below

But as the firelight went out

I knew that you were gone

I explained it was because

You had beaten us to the punch

But really I had fallen apart 

Because you were gone

And now I had to figure out another life 

You opened my eyes

To the life I had forgot

From so many years ago

I need to close them again

So it all doesn't escape

And the memory lives on

I'm sure you have felt loss

And you have all the same thoughts

But spending your life 

Trying to find

What is not only hidden but gone

Will make you miss and lose so much more

All you see

All you feel

All you fear

All you taste

All you hear

Is not a mistake

It wouldn't have changed

It's good you didn't see the

Tears fall on water below

But as the firelight went out

I knew that you were gone
